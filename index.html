      <h1>LGBTQ+ Inclusive Design</h1>
      <p>
        Digital platforms utilize data collection processes to assess
        demographic data about their users through user account (UA) creation.
        The information that these platforms require users to fill out include
        selecting preferences that provide options which oftentimes misrepresent
        gender and sexual orientation identities of users, disproportionately
        affecting the LGBTQ+ population. Presenting data from LGBTQ+ users of
        technology from our research, this website will show user account design
        features that may result in LGBTQ+ misrepresentation and exclusion. We
        ultimately informed our research findings to develop a digital playbook
        that aims to upskill and impact individuals in industry to implement
        LGBTQ+ inclusive design as a forethought within product development,
        which you can find [here - maybe link to that part of website?].

                    LGBTQ+ individuals often find community online, whether or
                    not they disclose their data. One aspect that might affect
                    disclosure is that miscategorization and misrepresentation
                    can lead to negative physical and mental health effects – as
                    seen in the U.S. where LGBTQ+ Adults are more likely to
                    experience symptoms of Anxiety and Depression.

                    In this research, authors found that PMs would often want to
                    start their processes in asking for feedback from Users.
                    Whether that is conducted by PMs or their UX Teams, this
                    chart shows how LGBTQ+ users prefer to give feedback. This
                    data was gathered from a user feedback survey to ensure we
                    gave the best advice to product professionals on how to
                    engage with their users more authentically.

                    Considering users’ sentiments and experiences navigating
                    user accounts, this research highlights experiences of
                    misrepresentation, distrust, and exclusion when users are
                    subjected to limited or inaccurate options during the
                    process of disclosing personal information across digital
                    user account platforms. As LGBTQ+ populations continue to
                    experience hardships offline, it is imperative that their
                    online experiences provide micro-affirmations about their
                    identities. Empowering PMs and those who help develop
                    digital products is certainly one path to reducing hardships
                    on the LGBTQ+ community.
